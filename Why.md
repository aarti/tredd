# Why Tredd

The Internet was going to be great.
Then
[advertising took over and turned everything to shit](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/internet-advertising-business.html).

It would be better if the customers of online services were
[the users instead of the advertisers](https://rushkoff.com/you-are-not-facebooks-customer/).
But that means paying for the services we all now receive for free.

Of course they’re not really free,
and that’s the problem.
The price is the hijacking of our attention,
and ultimately our _intention_,
using increasingly sophisticated tactics from
[psychological warfare](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psych-unseen/201803/the-internet-psychological-warfare-and-mass-conspiracy).

Nevertheless,
the services _feel_ free,
which means they are subject to
[the zero-price effect](https://market.subwiki.org/wiki/Zero_price_effect).
The zero-price effect means service providers can expect a significant drop in demand when charging even slightly more than zero.

Some services employ
[the freemium model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium):
they are ad-supported when offered for free,
but they can also be paid for by the user to eliminate ads and perhaps unlock additional features.

Enough people choosing the payment option of freemium would loosen the grip that Internet advertising has on us all.
But the implementation of freemium is problematic.
Never mind the price:
the _payment mechanisms_ of freemium involve too much overhead.
Each provider has its own separate payment “flow.”
Monthly subscriptions must be renewed.
Pricing tiers are coarse.
Think about it:
How many different service providers do _you_ want to deal with signing up for?

The goal of Tredd is to solve this part of the killing-advertising problem.
It demonstrates a uniform infrastructure for per-use micropayments that can be shared by all service providers.
