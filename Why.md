# Why Tredd

The Internet was going to be great.
Then
[advertising took over and turned everything to shit](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/internet-advertising-business.html).

It would be better if the customers of online services were
[the users instead of the advertisers](https://rushkoff.com/you-are-not-facebooks-customer/).
But that means paying for the services we all now receive for free.

Of course they’re not really free,
and that’s the problem.
The price is the hijacking of our attention,
and ultimately our _intention_,
using increasingly sophisticated tactics from
[psychological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare).

Nevertheless,
the services _feel_ free,
which means they are subject to
[the zero-price effect](https://market.subwiki.org/wiki/Zero_price_effect).
The zero-price effect means service providers can expect a significant drop in demand when charging even slightly more than zero.

Some services employ
[the freemium model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium):
they are ad-supported when offered for free,
but they can also be paid for by the user to eliminate ads and perhaps unlock additional features.

One problem with freemium is the overhead introduced by the payment layer.
Each provider has its own separate payment interface.
Monthly subscriptions must be renewed.
Pricing tiers are coarse.
How many different service providers do _you_ want to deal with signing up for?

The goal of Tredd is to provide part of a uniform micropay-per-use infrastructure that can be shared by all service providers.
